modName: "Morrowind World Randomizer"
modDescription: "A randomizer for many game elements.\nThe settings are individual for each character."
principles: "Principle of the item randomizer:\nFirst, the position of the object (or value) to be randomized is found in the sorted list,\n
then the boundary values of the region are calculated relative to it.\nLeft shift decrease(increase if negative) the minimum boundary value\n
by the shift value multiplied by the list length.\nRight shift increase(decrease if negative) the maximum boundary value\n
by the shift value multiplied by the list length.\n\n
For example, in a list of 100 elements,\nyou need to randomize the 50th with the left shift of 20% and the right of 10%.\n
The result will be a random object with a range of 30 to 60.\n
If the left shift is 100% and the right is 100% the result will be between 1 and 100.\n
If the left shift is -20% and the right is 40% the result will be between 70 and 90.\n
If the left shift is 40% and the right is -20% the result will be between 10 and 30.\n
If the left shift is 100% and the right is 0% the result will be between 1 and 50.\n
If the left shift is 0% and the right is 100% the result will be between 50 and 100.\n\nThe minimum range is 5% or 3 items.\nMost of the lists are sorted by object level."
